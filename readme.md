## Turborepo + NextJS apps + Vercel Reverse Proxy Starter Kit

This Turborepo contains 4 NextJS apps - proxy, www, api and route, each responsible for a single route and their subroutes. They can be deployed in isolation in Vercel.

These are the projects and the routes they serve.

- `www` - /
- `route` - /route
- `api` - /api
- `proxy` - Reverse proxy

The proxy is a reverse-proxy responsible for routing the requests to the appropriate microservice. 

The base domain when pointed to this, the routes point to the respective projects.
